# **Car Parking Space Counter**

This project is an intelligent Car Parking Space Counter developed using Python and OpenCV. It automatically detects and counts the number of occupied and free parking slots from a live video feed or static aerial image of a parking lot.

## Features

* Real-time Parking Space Detection using contour detection and pixel intensity analysis.

* Slot Status Visualization: Each parking slot is outlined in:
ðŸŸ¥ Red (occupied)
ðŸŸ© Green (free)
* Dynamic Counter Display: The total number of free and occupied spots is displayed clearly on the output image/video.
* Optimized for Overhead Views: Ideal for surveillance drone footage or top-down CCTV angles.
* Custom Slot Mapping: Parking spot positions are pre-defined using manual or semi-automated detection.
